            "abstract": "Together with people from Copenhagen's Pioneer Centre for AI and MLLS, the Center for Basic Machine Learning Research in Life Sciences, we are working on a manuscript on why Gaussian priors are ill-fitted because OOD data becomes Gaussian in latent space. We are hoping to submit this project to ICLR 2024.",

            "abstract": "My visit with Sarah Teichmann at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (Cambridge UK) resulted in an amazing collaboration. Emma Dann (PhD student), Sarah, Anders and I are currently finishing up a manuscript on applying our Deep Generative Decoder to multi-omics data. This type of data is high-dimensional (100k-300k features) and often contains few samples. Our method lends itself naturally to this task and besides showing SOTA performance on data integration, reconstruction and missing modality prediction, we introduce a new feature as an emergent property of the model. In our gene2peak functionality, we are able to predict cell-type specific associations between genes and chromatin regions, enabling us to perform various in silico experiments which can drastically advance research in gene regulation.",
