            "title": "MultiDGD",
            "abstract": "My visit with Sarah Teichmann at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (Cambridge UK) resulted in an amazing collaboration. Emma Dann (PhD student), Sarah, Anders and I have applied our Deep Generative Decoder to multi-omics data. This type of data is high-dimensional (100k-300k features) and often contains few samples. Our method lends itself naturally to this task and besides showing SOTA performance on data integration, reconstruction and missing modality prediction, we introduce new features as emergent properties of the model. In our gene2peak functionality, we are able to predict cell-type specific associations between genes and chromatin regions, enabling us to perform various in silico experiments which can drastically advance research in gene regulation. The paper will appear in Nature Communications in November 2024 in the human cell atlas bundle. Check out the preprint here.",
